**Flow icons**
Icons are consumed as a depedency for the `@cldcvr/flow-core` design framework. Icons are broken into packages to reduce bloat and allow for custom/community packs. Visit the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/cldcvr/flow-icon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute.

All icon packages that start with **"flow-"** are maintained by the flow-core design team.
